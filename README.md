# PSK_mod_demod_circuit
Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation and demodulation circuit simulations (via LTspice and Proteus) also contains the pcb gerbers.

This repository contains simulation files and circuit diagrams for Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation and demodulation. The project includes:

LTspice Files: Detailed circuit simulations for PSK modulation and demodulation.
Proteus Diagrams: Visual circuit schematics created using Proteus for easier understanding and implementation.
Purpose
The repository aims to:

Provide a comprehensive guide for understanding PSK techniques.
Enable students and professionals to replicate, simulate, and analyze PSK circuits.
Serve as a resource for academic and experimental projects related to digital communication.
Note
Currently, the demodulation circuit is under development, and there are some challenges in achieving accurate signal recovery. Contributions and suggestions to improve the design are highly appreciated.
